# Crochet blanket of yearly rainfall amount

Notebook includes partitioning of rainfall totals, plot demonstration of resulting colors and calculation of skeins needed of each color.

The csv file contains the yearly rainfall for the Red River Valley region from NCDC, but any other file could be used for a similar project!

Note: The gauge calculation should be adjusted per project.
